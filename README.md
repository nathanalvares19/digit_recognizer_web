# 🧠 Digit Recognizer Web App

A simple web application that allows users to draw digits on a canvas and get real-time predictions using a trained neural network model (MNIST-style). Built with **React** on the frontend and **FastAPI** on the backend.

## ✨ Features

- 🖌️ Canvas-based digit drawing interface
- 🔍 Real-time digit prediction using a trained `.keras` model
- 🚀 Full-stack architecture (React + FastAPI)
- 🐳 Dockerized for easy deployment
- ☁️ Cloud deployment (Render)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This digit recognizer uses a simple neural network trained on the MNIST dataset. While it performs well on clean, centered, 28x28 grayscale digits similar to those in the dataset, its accuracy may vary depending on:

- Drawing style or stroke thickness
- Digit alignment and positioning
- Background noise or image quality

**This model is intended for educational and demonstration purposes only.** It is not suitable for use in real-world applications requiring high accuracy or robustness.
